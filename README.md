This algorithm uses two pointers that move through a sequence at
different speeds to detect a cycle if any. Commonly known as the
Tortoise and the Hare Algorithm.

## How to Run
### Unit tests
To run the tests execute the following command

`$ruby tortoise_hare_test.rb`

### Sample code
`$ruby runners.rb`
